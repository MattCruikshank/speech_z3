# speech_z3
Use speech to control a z-machine interpreter (z3 only)

Download a z3 file to your computer from here:

https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/games/zcode/

And then launch this page:

https://mattcruikshank.github.io/speech_z3/

And then open your JavaScipt Console

And then click on "Choose file" (click on "Allow to use microphone") and select the z3 file.

Talk, and you'll see responses in the JavaScript Console.
